# Smaller Projects

## [Transformer Explainer](https://gabby-foxtrot-8e2.notion.site/Transformers-1066353a15494d8f82b677e226e777e0)
Here are a series of brief explainers I made for myself on the Transformer architecture. Many images taken from Jay Alammar's "The Illustrated Transformer"

# AI Projects
## [Project 1:  Transformer-From-Scratch ](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Transformer_From_Scratch)

This project was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's work at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY

We built a decoder-only Transformer from scratch, and training it on a corpus of Wikipedia data, to try and generate Wikipedia-style text. We will be training on: Wikitext - V2. Wikitext - V2 is a 2M word subset of the Wikipedia corpus.

The goal for the project was to:
- Define a decoder transformer architecture
- Train on the WikiText dataset
- Generate infinite Wikipedia-like text

(Due to model complexity, of course, the generated text does not resemble Wikipedia-style English)

# Basic Data Science Projects

## [Predicting Heart Disease](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Key_Indicators_of_Heart_Disease)

The aim of this project was to predict a patient's heart disease status (0 or 1), based on a variety of markers (personal and biological)

I used the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset, located: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

For our ML models, we will explore:
- Logistic Regressoin
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest Classifiers

## [Predicting Banking Subscription](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Banking_Subscription_Prediction)

The aim of this project is to see whether we can predict whether a client subscribed to a term deposit after a direct marking campaign from a Portugese bank.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, based on phone calls (Moro, Cortez, and Rita 2014).

The goal of the campaigns were to get the clients to subscribe to a term deposit. There are 20 input variables and 1 binary output variable (y) that indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit with values ‘yes’,‘no’.

We try a few different classification methods, including:

    Logistic Regression
    Random Forests
    K-Nearest Neighbours
    Support Vector Machines
    Neural Networks.
