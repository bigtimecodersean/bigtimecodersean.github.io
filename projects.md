Projects I've done 

--------

# AI (Coding)
### [Transformer-From-Scratch ](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Transformer_From_Scratch)

This project was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's work at: [Let's Build GPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). 

The goal for the project was to:
- Define a decoder-only transformer architecture
- Train on the WikiText V2 dataset
- Generate infinite Wikipedia-like text

### [Vision Transformer-From-Scratch](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Vision_Transformer_Replication)

I replicated a Vision Transformer, as developed in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929 ... and applied it to a classifying food categories. This project was part of Zero-to-Mastery's: Deep Learning with Pytorch

### [Fine-Tuning Stanford Cars Classifier](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Fine_Tuning_Stanford_Cars_Classification)
We are fine-tuning a few vision models (effnetb0 & GoogleNet) on the StanfordCars dataset to classify cars. We then deploy our top-performing model as a Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces.

Dataset: [StanfordCars](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars.html#torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars)

# AI (non-coding) 

### [Numenta Active Dendrite](https://5744f6c2-4ed8-4ec0-a6a4-51909cc8f220.filesusr.com/ugd/e97160_d98a19334c954743adf683cb1df2b919.pdf)

Here is a written companion I wrote to a talk by Numenta's Subutai Ahmad Numenta titled: Active Dendrites Enable Flexible Context Integration. Active dendrites are a more biologically realistic model of individual neurons, enabling better prediction, more flexible learning, and efficient, sparse representations in Artificial Neural Networks.  

### [Investigating Motif Significance in the Drosophilidae Drosophila](https://5744f6c2-4ed8-4ec0-a6a4-51909cc8f220.filesusr.com/ugd/e97160_dcc99d36de424a1fbed10f7f4e635463.pdf)

Investigated recently mapped Drosophila fruit-fly connectome to measure the prevalence of complex structural network motifs, compared to C.elegans and simulated rat somatosensory cortex. Found a decrease in basic motifs, such as basic linked chains; an increase in more complex feedback structures (ie. 3-node structures with bidirectional connections)

# Basic Data Science Projects

### [Intro NLP Project: Spooky Author Topic Modeling](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Intro_NLP_Author_Topic_Modeling)

A project to introduce myself to NLP: a very basic attempt at topic modelling this [Spooky Author dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification)

### [African Water Basin Temperatures](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/African_Water_Basin_Temperatures)

The goal of this project was to plot a high-resolution figure showing the average increaes in air temperature in African Water Basics, from 2000-2014.

### [Predicting Heart Disease](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Key_Indicators_of_Heart_Disease)

The aim of this project was to use a variety of ML models to predict a patient's heart disease status (0 or 1), based on a variety of markers (personal and biological), using the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset, located: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

### [Predicting Banking Subscription](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Banking_Subscription_Prediction)

The aim of this project was to use a variery of classificatoin methods to predict whether a client subscribed to a term deposit after a direct marking campaign from a Portugese bank.

### [Colorado Climate Change Perspectives](https://github.com/bigtimecodersean/Colorado-Climate-Change-Perspectives)

We'll be looking at the results of a survey of residents in Colorado about their viewpoints on climate change. 
The data can be found on GitHub at: [data]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envirodatascience/ENVS-617-Class-Data/main/CO_climate_change_views.csv')

# Miscellaneous Projects

### [Exlporing the Phenomenology of Haptic Stimulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga88RGOzJwk) 

Designed and built a multi-sensory stimulation device that uses light, sound, and haptic vibration to induce targeted emotional states, for use in psychedelic therapy clinics. In addition to building the device, I spent time mapping out the phenomenology of haptic vibration.

(For NDA purposes, I cannot publish photos of the finished product)


### [Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation Landscape](https://5744f6c2-4ed8-4ec0-a6a4-51909cc8f220.filesusr.com/ugd/e97160_c793c5047dbe41dd81a33ba53468d0bf.pdf)

Two separate presentations to a group of neurotechnology investors and researchers on the landscape of Focused Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (fTUS) for neuromodulation in the treatment of brain disorders and mental health conditions


### [Geothermal Energy Drilling](https://5744f6c2-4ed8-4ec0-a6a4-51909cc8f220.filesusr.com/ugd/e97160_0f790d08b3854e9ba95aa4fb85f51c48.pdf) 

Mapping out the landscape of Geothermal Energy drilling technology. I focused in particular on Millimeter Wave drilling, of the type proposed by Quaise Energy I also propose the basic components of what a Geothermal PARPA might look like.

# Explainers
Technical explainers I have made on different subjects. 

## [Transformer Explainer](https://gabby-foxtrot-8e2.notion.site/Transformers-1066353a15494d8f82b677e226e777e0)
Here are a series of brief explainers I made for myself on the Transformer architecture. Many images taken from Jay Alammar's "The Illustrated Transformer"
